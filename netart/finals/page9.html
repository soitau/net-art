<p>You have successfully sneaked inside and see the Penguin talking to another popular mobster, Anthony Zucco.</p>
<p>You overhear Anthony Zucco asking the Penguin if he can help him get rid of DNA that can trace Zucco to the circus. </p>
<p>Now you have your new prime suspect, Anthony Zucco, confess to being at the circus.</p>
<p>What is your next move?</p>

    <p><a href="page10.html">Immediately arrest Anthony Zucco on the spot</a></p>
    <p><a href="page11.html">Go back to the scene and test DNA from the scene of the crime</a></p>
