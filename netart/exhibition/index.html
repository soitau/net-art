    <h1> Digital Neon Display</h1>
    <h2>Curated by Sophia Turcios</h2>
    <h3>The aesthetic connections between the net arts that I have chosen surround cyberpunk aesthetics. The aesthetics include various amounts of bright neon lighting and futuristic styles. The websites themselves showcase different messages but the styles stood out to me. The aesthetic connection between the net arts was the use of neon green colors against a dark (usually black) background. The color scheme being incorporated in different ways and different techniques is what I liked about the pieces.</h3>


    <h3>The term “cyberpunk” originated in 1980 by Bruce Bethke who coined the term.  The word was combined with “cybernetics” which is replacing human functions with computerized ones and the word “punk” a music genre popular in the 1970s and 80s that contains loud, fast-paced, aggressive sounds.  The term cyberpunk is now a subgenre of science fiction showing integration of technology into society whilst dehumanizing high-tech futures.</h3>
      
      
    <h3>For a piece to be cyberpunk in the 90s is shown in the first example of net arts. The technology was growing at the time but there were some who did not want to use new technology and opted to stay with older pieces of technology. A piece being cyberpunk in recent times is shown in the last net art where it implements futuristic designs in the art piece. I believe that they both have different connotations because new technology was being created in the 80s and 90s such as the World Wide Web, digital cameras, Apple Macintosh, and the first mobile phone. I believe that was when the cyberpunk aesthetic was growing and evolving such as films being created like Blade Runner (1982). However, I think that now with phones and computers in the new digital era people have gotten used to the integration of technology into our society.</h3>

  <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/386-dx"> 386 DX</a>
  <p>386 DX is known as “The World's First Cyberpunk band” created by Alexei Shulgin, a Russian artist from 1998 to 2013. The live performances included colorful digital graphics that featured MIDI tracks for drums, guitar, synth, and lyrics. Shulgin's reason for creating this was because he had a reliance on net artists that used new technology. The technology he used was purposefully powered by cheap technology, a PC with a 386 DX chip would sing songs from lyric sheets. The visuals of the performances consisted of different colored lines that would appear and disappear and have different patterns.</p>

  <a href="http://we-link.chronusartcenter.org/sideways/"> We=Link: Sideways</a>
  <p>The title of this netart is “We=Link: Sideways” and the date is from November 2020 to May 2021. The organization is from Chronus Art Center (CAC), Shanghai and curated by ZHANG Ga. The website showcases the evolution of netart that appeared in the early 90's and grew until 1997. Netart was seen as reaching its “dead end” because of the commodification of the internet. However, this netart shows how the “dead end” was truly a new beginning for netart because of the new ways of using netart instead of strictly adhering to the categorical definition of what it was.</p>

  <p>The title of this netart is m9ndfukc.0+99 created by Netochka Nezvanova, a pseudonym, in 1999. The central idea of this work was translating data and code whilst using data as raw material to generate unpredictable and surprising outcomes. Her work was to show the potential of randomness, noise, and the unexpected thus creating audiovisual manifestations based on these factors.</p>

  <a href="https://cyberfem.garagemca.radio/en/">Cyberfem</a>
  <p>The title of this piece is “Cyberfem” created by Anna Soz in 2023 with  a main focus on feminist strategies and themes. The website includes audio from independent musicians and sound artists. Her inspiration is from the Cyber-Femin-Club which was a way to explore feminist strategies from the perspective of a Russian-speaking world. It was a space where political, artistic, and technological practices were implemented by women. </p>
